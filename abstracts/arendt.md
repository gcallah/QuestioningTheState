The State is a Body constructed of the bodies, both artificial, such as State's institutions, and natural, the citizens
of the State themselves. Drawing from Hannah Arendt's works, this paper examines specific conditions under which the
state loses the justification of its actions. For instance, the invasion of neighboring countries or genocide
perpetrated against its own citizens on ethnic or religious grounds. Arendt argues that a genuinely just and free
political order rests upon the principle of plurality, requiring active citizen engagement, legitimate authority, and
collective responsibility. Building upon her insight that political freedom is fundamentally incompatible with
domination, violence, and atrocities, this paper explores Arendt's critical distinction between political power and
violence. It argues that states involved in atrocities dismantle their foundational legitimacy, undermining conditions
necessary for political freedom and transforming themselves into mere apparatuses of coercion and violence. Through an
analysis informed by Arendt's treatment of Eichmann's case, this paper also interrogates the issue of responsibility,
clarifying how collective responsibility emerges from participation in institutional frameworks that enable state
crimes. It further argues that political responsibility demands a shift from purely individual accountability toward
recognizing broader societal and institutional culpability. Ultimately, the paper explores an Arendtian model of the
international political order, emphasizing accountability and collective responsibility as essential conditions for
justice. It concludes by arguing that international institutions, established specifically to prevent atrocities and
injustices, also bear collective responsibility when they fail in their mandate, thus underscoring the urgency of
rethinking international accountability through an Arendtian lens.
