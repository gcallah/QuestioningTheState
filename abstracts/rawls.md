# John Rawls and the Original Position

Jason Ferrell

Few scholars have had as large an impact upon their field as John Rawls, and fewer works have provoked as large a
response as his A Theory of Justice.   Among the contributions he made that solidified his place as a figure of note,
none are more significant than the concept of the 'Original Position' which stands at the heart of this work.   A
purported attempt to distill the core tenets of the idea of the social contract at a more abstract level, Rawls'
argument led to a vigorous reconsideration of contemporary liberalism and the study of political philosophy that then
dominated the latter part of the 20th century.  In particular, Rawls arguably revitalized the attempt to provide an
account of state institutions that morally grounds them, such that they can be regarded as legitimate by the people they
govern from a liberal perspective.  Whatever the success of his discussion, it pays to review both the historical
significance and the analytical intricacies of Rawls' views.  For while much has been written about the Original
Position, many of the criticisms levelled at Rawls have often involved mischaracterizing what he actually did, thereby
displaying a misapprehension of what he said.  My goal is to bring to the fore some of the overlooked and neglected
aspects of Rawls' arguments, in order to recover the novelty of his position and display its strength.
