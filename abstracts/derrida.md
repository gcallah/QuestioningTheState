# Jacques Derrida on the Abyss of the State

Nils Hofmann, University of Vienna

Can the state be justified if its foundation is unavoidably violent? In this text, I approach a deconstructive theory of
the state by reconstructing Jacques Derrida’s notion of legitimacy-to- come with reference to the abyss at the heart of
its violent founding. I argue that the state can only be justified insofar as it permanently dejustifies itself in the
name of the Other it violently excludes from the moment of its founding, thereby opening a way to rethink the democratic
beyond classical sovereignty.

First, I explore Derrida’s appropriation of Heidegger’s concept of the abyss to demonstrate that the constitutive power
underlying the founding of the state cannot itself be grounded in any absolute principle, such as natural law or the
will of a people. Consequently, state foundations are abyssal, violent acts that possess no final legitimacy.

Second, I trace how Derrida’s political writings develop the argument that states necessarily presuppose the violent
exclusion of the Other - such as those excluded from the sovereign people - in order to constitute themselves
reflexively as states. The state therefore remains always responsively accountable to the Other it excludes. Yet, this
very reflexivity toward the Other within the state’s order also becomes the site of its deconstruction.

Third, I elaborate on how this site of the state’s deconstruction paradoxically entails the possibility of sovereignty -
insofar as the state asserts itself against the Other it excludes - and the possibility of opening toward that Other to
let justice come. Whether a state’s decision is just can never be fully determined in the present but is disclosed only
in the mode of legitimacy- to-come (Future Perfect). The state must justify its actions in light of the future - in
terms of what will have been just. Finally, I illustrate this deconstructive logic in judicial decision-making and in
the concept of citizenship.
