# Noam Chomsky's Anarcho-Syndicalism

Anindita Adhikari

This paper examines dissent against the state to argue that there is no obligation to obey state authority. Chomsky's
critique of the state shows how any such political obligation is unjustified. Today states across the world are no
longer on the spectrum of left and right. Rather, authority in states is held by the ruling elite in different areas
from economy to technology. States are no longer democratic but largely plutocratic. Chomsky defines anarchism as
challenging the domination of authority. This is done by asking for justification of the state's power, failing which
such an authority is illegitimate. Such a challenge is the basis of dissent and protest against the state's control of
its citizens. Chomsky's anarcho-syndicalism provides an alternative as state control increasingly takes an autocratic
form with increasing inequality, misuse of laws, and crackdowns on minorities. Using digital mass media, nowadays states
exercise control through the likes of surveillance, misinformation, and hate speech. Further curbing activism by showing
protest as an attack on the state, deeming it violent or threatening social unrest. In this situation, dissent is useful
in understanding the extent of political obligationâ€”as states violate the rights of their citizens and compromise
individual autonomy with their authoritarianism.
