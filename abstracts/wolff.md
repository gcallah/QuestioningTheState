# Robert Paul Wolff's Autonomy Thesis of Anarchism

Steven Coyne

Though Wolff's characterization of (legitimate) authority helped to inspire the modern characterization of authority in
terms of exclusionary and content-independent reasons, I will argue that his actual objection to authority is not fully
captured in those terms. Wolff objects not only to exclusion and content-independence, but also to the overall changes
that obedience would make on the structure of how one deliberates. For a person to act autonomously, they must endorse
their own moral principles, and then apply them to the world. Wolff argues that a person who obeys another person would
not give due place to these principles in their deliberation, and thus that legitimate authority is impossible.
 
I argue that when Wolff's challenge is framed in this way, it poses a renewed problem for liberals, who face a limited
and unsuccessful set of options for responding to him. I divide possible liberal responses to Wolff into three
categories. The first I will call liberal moralism, which generalizes various attempts to derive a requirement of
obedience from moral principles (like the principle of fair play). Wolff does not explicitly address the possibility of
liberal moralism, but I argue on his behalf that liberal moralism fails to reconcile authority and autonomy. The second,
consent, is well known, and I expand on Wolff's brief explanation for why it does not reconcile authority and autonomy.
The final one is Raz's well-known service conception of authority, which says that we should treat authoritative
commands as binding insofar as doing so helps us better conform to right reason. It is often thought that one of the
major advantages of the service conception is its ability to respond to Wolff's challenge. While it might be able to
respond to earlier interpretations of Wolff's challenge, I argue that that it is unable to address Wolff's deeper
worries about structure of deliberation.
