# Beyond Coercion and Ideology: Rethinking Althusser's State Theory


Özhan Öztür

This paper will explore the layers of Louis Althusser's critique of the state, focusing on its dual dimensions: the
economic-coercive and the ideological-non-coercive. Althusser's theory occupies a crucial middle ground within Western
Marxism, synthesizing elements of both Western and Eastern Marxist traditions. Rather than a simple rejection of the
state, Althusser views it as a complex apparatus operating through both material conditions and ideological mechanisms,
which are essential for the reproduction of capitalist society. My aim is to first unpack these distinct layers of his
theory, analyzing the interplay between economic forces and ideological structures. In doing so, I will also examine
reductionist interpretations of Althusser that have wrongly simplified his position by overlooking his engagement with
economic conditions in favor of ideology. These interpretations fail to recognize how Althusser integrates both economic
and ideological factors, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the state's function. By critically revisiting
Althusser's thought, this paper will challenge these oversimplified readings and emphasize the continued relevance of
his framework for analyzing the state in contemporary capitalist societies.
