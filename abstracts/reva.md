This chapter reconstructs, from Hannah Arendt's political thought, the conditions under which a state becomes
"unjustified." Drawing on *The Origins of Totalitarianism*, *On Violence*, *Eichmann in Jerusalem*, and *The Human Condition*,
it argues that a state forfeits its justification not primarily through discrete illegality, but through the erosion of
the common world that makes politics possible. First, the chapter clarifies Arendt's account of power as the capacity to
act in concert and her distinction between legitimacy and the merely contingent justification of violence, contrasting
her position with Max Weber's and Walter Benjamin's influential theories of state force. Second, it traces how power
decays when administration replaces politics, especially through rule by decree, proliferating bureaucratic apparatuses,
and the diffusion of responsibility that enables "Eichmann-like" compliance. Third, it identifies two decisive
thresholds at which the state irreversibly loses its political ground: the creation of rightlessness and the
institutionalization of terror, which isolate individuals and disable spontaneous initiative. Finally, these dynamics
are synthesized into five diagnostic criteria of the unjustified state: (1) transformation into organized criminality,
(2) administration and decree displacing positive law, (3) terror as the foundation of domination, (4) systematic
killing of spontaneity, and (5) the project of rendering human beings superfluous. By treating de-justification as a
progression rather than a single legal breach, the paper clarifies warning signs of anti-political transformation and
highlights what an Arendtian remedy would require: accountable institutions, publicly intelligible law, civic
responsibility, and a shared world that keeps action possible.
