# Robert Nozick's Ultra-Minimal State

One of the intellectual sensations of the 1970s in moral and political philosophy was the publication in 1974 of Robert
Nozick's book Anarchy, State and Utopia.  It was partly written as a refutation of another sensation that shortly
preceded it, John Rawls' A Theory of Justice (1971).  Rawls was a social democrat who argued for an active,
redistributive state based on common principles of justice whereas Nozick was a libertarian who believed that the
Rawlsian state goes too far since nothing beyond an ultra-minimal state is just.  Nozick also wrote his book to refute
the claims of anarcho-capitalists like Murray Rothbard who argued that no state can be justified.  He builds his case
against both Rawls and Rothbard on controversial assumptions about rights and individual self-ownership that have
stimulated a great deal of debate but won few intellectual converts.
