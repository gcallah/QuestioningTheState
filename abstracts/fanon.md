# Frantz Fanon on the Illegitimacy of Oppressive States

Jordan Liz, San Jose State University

Drawing on Fanon's work, this paper examines the conditions under which a state is politically illegitimate. It is
divided into three sections. The first section provides a critical overview of Fanon's account of the colonial state. It
focuses on his theory of oppression, as well as the material, psychological and existential harms of colonization. 

In the second section, I argue that, from a Fanonian perspective, the question of the state's legitimacy is not
reducible to the issue of exploitation or even the denial of rights alone. Rather, a state is illegitimate if it reduces
people to a "being through others," an ontological status wherein the meaning of one's life and identity are
unilaterally dictated by those in power. For Fanon, within the colonial context, Blackness – the idea of what Black
people are like, the purported 'biological' reality of their racial inferiority, etc. – was fabricated by Europeans and
violently forced upon the colonized. Those ideas shape every interaction the colonized have with others, as well as how
they perceive themselves and their own possibilities. In "being through others," the colonized are in a constant state
of self-alienation wherein their capacities to self-define and create meaning in the world are denied. For Fanon, this
status is at the core of "the colonized mind" that decolonization seeks to eliminate. Ultimately, any state that fails
to embrace an openness to human possibilities and flourishing, that lacks a commitment to a radical humanism, is
illegitimate. 

The third section examines the role of violence in the decolonial struggle, focusing on both its positive and negative
outcomes. Arguably, if a state is politically illegitimate on Fanon's view, then it would necessitate political
struggle. As such, by way of conclusion, this section asks whether political struggles against contemporary
oppressive/illegitimate states should ever resort to violence.
