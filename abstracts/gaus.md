# Gerald Gaus's Justification for the State

Kevin Valier, University of Toledo

Gerald Gaus offers a distinctive justification for state authority grounded in the idea of public justification. For
Gaus, political authority and coercion are legitimate only when the rules governing them can be justified to each person
subject to them, respecting that person's diverse evaluative standards. This requirement stems from the value of moral
relations, such as trust, friendship, and love, as well as the reactive attitudes that sustain them. Gaus's approach
yields neither anarchism nor an extensive state, but what Gaus calls a "classical tilt" toward limited state authority.
The state is not justified in imposing comprehensive economic planning or extensive redistribution of wealth. These
coercive proposals lack public justification given widespread and reasonable disagreement. Yet neither can public
justification limit the state to merely libertarian functions. Reasonable people have sufficient reason to support
public goods provision and social insurance, for example. The chapter will explore how Gaus's theory of public
justification, developed across his major works from *Value and Justification* through *The Open Society and Its
Complexities*, determines the scope and limits of state authority. The article focuses on articulating Gaus's view
through combining a presumption against coercion and the diversity of reasoning in modern pluralistic societies. Unlike
traditional social contract approaches that ground authority in hypothetical agreements or shared reasons, Gaus
demonstrates how political authority can be justified even amid profound evaluative disagreement, provided that
authority respects the constraints of public justification.
