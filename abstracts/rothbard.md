# Murray Rothbard's Case for Anarchy

Billy Christmas

Murray Rothbard’s philosophical arguments have had a significant influence on the American libertarian movement.
He synthesized elements of both Kantian and Lockean natural law theory.
The most unorthodox aspect of his theory of natural rights was that they made a
legitimate state a logical impossibility. The state, as a monopoly on the
authorized use of coercion in society, must necessarily use coercion to sustain its monopoly.
This coercion violates the natural rights of those who would otherwise compete with the state
in the production of public goods like arbitration and security, and those who would otherwise
choose a different agent to protect their rights. In this essay I will outline the influence of
Rothbard’s anarchism, his arguments for it and is response to critiques, as well as his positive
vision of a society in which natural rights prevail – anarcho-capitalism. I will then offer an
internal critique of Rothbard’s anarchist conclusion and
demonstrate the space that remains for a state within a natural rights view of law and social order.
