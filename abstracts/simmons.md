# Simmons on State Legitimacy

Jeff Carroll

This paper concerns the concepts of justification and legitimacy in the work of A. John Simmons. Legitimacy refers to
the moral right the state has to be the exclusive imposer of duties on the citizenry and the permission to use force to
enforce those duties, if necessary. The literature on political obligation is rife with attempts to provide a theory
that successfully establishes the legitimacy of the state. Simmons finds all such attempts lacking. But he does not find
all attempts to justify the state unsuccessful. Many existing states are justified, according to Simmons. Yet,
surprisingly, there is much less work done on what he means by justification. In general, 'justification' refers to
showing whether an act, a strategy, a practice, an arrangement, or an institution is prudentially rational, morally
acceptable, or both. I am to provide additional insight into how best to interpret Simmons's account of justification.
In one sense, it is a way of measuring the quality of states. In another sense, it is a way of measuring reason not to
act to undermine the state. I consider ways of reconciling these different senses. Then I show how it fits into
Simmons's broadly Lockean theory. In short, legitimacy stems from consent and is separate from the state's quality. A
justified state may offer reasons not to undermine it (say, because it is high-quality), but it does not inherently
create a duty to obey; that requires particularized consent. The mistake made by Kantians, including Rawlsians, is in
blurring this distinction.
