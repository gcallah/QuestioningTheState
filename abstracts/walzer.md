# Michael Walzer on Political Legitimacy and Wars of Intervention

Leonard Kahn

When should one state consider another state legitimate? According to Michael Walzer, a state's legitimacy must be
assessed from two perspectives: internal and external (1980). While internally a state must justify itself to those it
governs by both supporting shared social goods (1983) and protecting the self-determination of minority groups within
the broader political order (1997), externally a state must justify itself to other states and the international
community by refraining from interference in their affairs, that is, by respecting their right to self-determination
(1977).

This two-sided approach raises an awkward question. Suppose that a state uses coercive force to repress and persecute
minorities within its own borders but does not, in the process, interfere with other states. Would these other states be
justified in intervening militarily? Walzer's answer is that intervention is permissible only in cases that are
especially egregious and only in ways that adhere to very strict limitations. For the most part, states that fail the
internal test of legitimacy are off limits from military interventions as long as they pass the external test of
legitimacy (1977 and 2004).

While this result seems paradoxical (e.g., Miller 2014), I argue that the apparent tension in Walzer's thought is
overstated. It stems from the mistaken assumption that he treats self-determination as a master value to be promoted.
But it is neither. First, Walzer's pluralism precludes any such overarching value. Second, we need to distinguish
between values that are to be promoted and values that are to be honored (Pettit 1989). For Walzer, self-determination
is a value to be honored in context, which, in international relations, typically takes the form of non-interference. On
this view, the international community may regard a state as illegitimate without thereby being justified in using
military force against it. Legitimacy, in the external sense, is not a threshold for action but a constraint on it.
