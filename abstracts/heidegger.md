# Heidegger on State Authority: Being, Nature, and History

Taylor Green, Carleton University
 

The purpose of this chapter is to uncover the complex relationship of Heidegger's concept of the state and its
justification. Heidegger's account of state authority is not a scholarly subject of interest to interpreters of his
thought. This topical absence is primarily due to Heidegger's political association of 1933. It is also due to his
vehement criticism of Western metaphysics, where he describes state authority for the political regimes of American
liberalism and Soviet communism as belonging to the same metaphysical and technological deracination. Heidegger,
however, during two semesters in 1933-1934, postulates directly on politics, statecraft, state authority, and the people
of a state, compiled as the lecture series On the Essence of Nature, History, State. In these lectures, evident is his
complex relationship to the modern state, tracing Being as determinative authority from the ancient Greek polis and
transitioning to modernity. It is uncertain whether and to what degree Heidegger is justifying the state to meet the
ends of his own regime commitment. Rather, what is clear is that Heidegger's conception of a nation-state, with its
derivation from a people determined and legitimized by Being, is a topic at the forefront of a political-philosophical
discourse. To detail Heidegger on state authority is bound to a question of Being, nature, and history. History, as the
unfolding of Being, determines all regimes as historically legitimate, as this process is the state of Being for a
people. Heidegger leaves us without philosophical criteria to practically judge whether any state is politically
beneficial to the people or not. Where a people exist in the site of Being from sheer history, a state is founded to be
symmetrical with its historical-spiritual essence.
