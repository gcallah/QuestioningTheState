# On Some Libertarian Intuition Pumps

David Pereplyotchik

Michael Huemer's book, The Problem of Political Authority (Palgrave, 2012), offers an array of arguments against the
moral and political legitimacy of the State.  Following in the footsteps of libertarians like Robert Nozick, Huemer
argues in particular that taxation as a means of providing public goods is generally indefensible, amounting to little
more than armed robbery.  As in the case of Nozick, many of the arguments one finds in this book take the form of what
the late Daniel Dennett has called "intuition pumps" — hypothetical scenarios that are designed to motivate a specific
claim or principle.  To Huemer's credit, the vignettes peppered throughout the book are often lively and entertaining,
involving rogue vigilantes, sinking life rafts, crooked money lenders, and psychotic boardroom meetings.  Nevertheless,
when examined carefully, the arguments underlying the intuition pumps fall apart — or so I argue in the present paper.
My aim here is to cast a critical eye on several of Huemer's thought experiments, developing objections rooted in the
work of Alasdair MacIntyre, David Graeber, and Martha Nussbaum, among others.
