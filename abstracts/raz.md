# A Razian Audit of State Authority: Political Obligation, Legal Directives, and the Limits of Legitimate Power

Karim Dharamsi, Mount Royal University

This chapter applies Joseph Raz's "service conception" of authority to reframe the perennial question of political
obligation: Can the state be justified? Raz offers a non-voluntarist alternative to consent-based theories by positing
that legitimate authority must serve the governed -- that is, enable individuals to better act on the reasons that
already apply to them. A legal directive is authoritative only when it satisfies both the dependence thesis (it
reflects subjects' existing reasons) and the normal justification thesis (obedience helps subjects better conform to
those reasons). When both conditions hold, the directive acquires pre-emptive force and displaces further deliberation.
When either fails, no moral duty to obey arises.

The chapter outlines Raz's framework and tests it against three contemporary case studies from liberal democratic
states: (1) COVID-19 public health mandates, (2) anti-protest laws aimed at environmental and civil rights
demonstrations, and (3) Quebec's secularism legislation (Bill 21). These cases illustrate how the same state can, in
some instances, meet Raz's demanding standards -- and in others, issue directives that are legally binding but morally
inert. In particular, anti-protest laws and secular dress bans fail to align with the governed's own reasons, rendering
them coercive rather than authoritative.

Rather than defend philosophical anarchism, this chapter argues for a more exacting liberalism -- one that treats state
legitimacy as a moral achievement. The Razian framework thus provides not only a principled diagnostic tool but a
normative benchmark for reform in pluralistic constitutional orders.
