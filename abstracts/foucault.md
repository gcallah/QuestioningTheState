# Michel Foucault on Power Relations and Governmentalities

**Keywords**: Foucault, power, governmentality, discipline, biopolitics

Foucault saw power as dispersed across the whole society and deeply entangled in diverse
social networks, discourses, beliefs, and practices. This view challenges hierarchical and concentrated
conceptions of state power in several ways. First, if power permeates all levels of society,
governmentality should be understood in a more decentralized fashion, which tends to de-emphasize
the explanatory and normative role of the state. Second, all power is productive, not merely oppressive,
since it generates and transforms new forms of agency, subjectivity, knowledge, and social networks.
Third, avenues for counter-power permeate the interstices of the social order, which means that
resistance can take diverse forms beyond the traditional method of a revolution that challenges
and overtakes the state apparatus. To illustrate how these Foucauldian insights apply to sovereign
power - the power of the state - this chapter offers a short summary of pastoral power,
disciplinary power, and biopower. Sovereign state power can utilize and constitute any of
these diverse types, or styles, of power. Foucault thus offers avenues for thinking of power
as the historical product of the transformations of "épistémès" - constellations of power-knowledge
that have changed, and will change further, over time. Although normatively ambiguous, Foucault's
writings - whether on madness, criminality, sexuality, neoliberalism, or the Iranian revolution - 
contain an implicit commitment to discovering new, creative, and emancipatory ways of relating
to ourselves and to society. State authority, too, can be assessed and critiqued, if not exactly
straightforwardly justified or annulled, from this point of view. The chapter concludes with some
remarks on why normative Foucauldian political and social theory is not an oxymoron despite his
self-conscious predilection for the detached, historical-genealogical mode of analysis.
