# Is Justification of the Existence of Government a Useful Question?

Daniel B. Klein

To contemplate justification for the existence of something is to contemplate whether it is justified for a human to aim
either to bring that thing into original existence or to annihilate that thing as it exists.

If the something is government, then, either way, the action is farfetched and
hard to imagine. To speculate on the consequences is jejune, because the whole matter
is so far from our human experience and knowledge.
The piece would contend that it is not useful—even, not meaningful, perhaps—to
wrestle with the question of the justification for the existence of government. The piece
would express the attitude that the existence of government is an unalterable reality.
Like mortality, it is something to be managed but not justified.
The piece would likely suggest that we are still very much in the period of history
of Hume's liberal adage: "liberty is the perfection of civil society; but still authority must
be acknowledged essential to its very existence." It is apt to understand "authority" as
government authority and hence government. I will explain what Hume meant by the
adage.

I will argue that as long as that the adage is true, it makes little sense for liberty-
lovers to ponder whether a government-free or anarchic society would be desirable.
I will suggest that the adage was true in Hume's day, is true in our day, will be true
500 years from today (assuming humankind exists). For classical liberals such as
myself, the proper aim is in the spirit of Hume, Smith, and Burke, to make government
better (which will generally mean making it smaller). I would deal with Hume, Smith, and
Burke, to mine their writings for their attitude toward the notion of justifying the existence
of government.
