# Introduction

Political obligation remains one of the most discussed, and contested, topics in political philosophy. Whether there is
a peremptory or prima facie duty to obey the state has been the subject of rigorous philosophical debate, with
philosophers offering various theories both in support of and against political obligation. 
 
Many theorists argue that if individuals are obligated to obey the state, then the state must possess legitimate
authority. Defending such authority requires that the state itself be justified. Thus, a foundational question in the
debate on political obligation is whether the state can, in fact, be justified. Philosophical anarchists challenge this
premise, arguing that the state cannot be justified, and therefore cannot claim a moral right to demand obedience. 

What grounds, if any, can be offered for the authority of the state, and citizens' duty to obey its laws? We will
explore various recent attempts to justify state authority, as well as some efforts to claim that there is no
justification.

This edited volume invites contributions from researchers engaging with contemporary discussions on this question,
focusing on developments from the 20th century to the present. The scope of the book is limited to the Western
philosophical tradition.
