**Questioning the State**

**Introduction**

The question of the justification of the state has received sustained
attention in political philosophy since the 20th century, and the debate
remains unresolved. Of particular importance is the renewed interest in
the liberal tradition, which appears to have deepened rather than
settled the issue. In response, various forms of voluntarist theories
have been developed to explain how the state may, or ought to, claim a
moral right to demand obedience from its citizens.

Central to the voluntarist tradition is the notion of consent, though
other frameworks such as H.L.A. Hart's and John Rawls's principle of
fair play continue to play a significant role. Utilitarian arguments and
functionalist approaches, which justify the state based on its ability
to solve coordination problems, have also contributed significantly to
the discussion. But are these accounts---voluntarist, fair play,
utilitarian, or otherwise---adequate?

Despite the numerous theories offered in defense of the state, the
justification of the state remains contested. Philosophical
anarchists**,** neo-anarchists**,** critical theorists**,** and
minimalist theorists have advanced various arguments questioning or
rejecting the legitimacy of the state.

The persistent questions include:

-   What compelling grounds, if any, justify the rejection or critique
    of the state?
-   Is the anarchist challenge philosophically sustainable?
-   Are some kinds of states justifiable, while others are not?
-   If so, by what criteria do we distinguish between justified and
    unjustified states?
-   What frameworks, if any, can robustly support or dismantle the
    state's claim to moral authority over individuals?

These and related questions remain central to contemporary discourse on
the state and political obligation.

This edited volume invites contributions from scholars engaged with
current debates on the legitimacy of the state, focusing on developments
from the 20th century to the present. The scope of the volume is limited
to the Western philosophical tradition.
