Nils Hofmann, MD, BA, is currently a Master's student in Philosophy and Political Science at the University of Vienna
and a medical doctor trained at the Medical University of Vienna. His MA thesis, which he is about to defend, explores a
deconstructive theory of the foundation of law following Jacques Derrida. His research focuses on deconstructive legal
philosophy, the relationship between religion and the state, and the nexus of the political and the ethicalâ€”particularly
in the context of medical ethics and artificial intelligence. His forthcoming essay, "Autonomy Against the Machine:
Clinical Decision-Making and the Politics of AI," will be published in October.
